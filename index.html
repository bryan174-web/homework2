<h3>My career goals</h3>
<p>I would like to find a job as a graphic designer, or a job similar to graphic design like a 3D animator or a job in motion graphics, or a web design job.
    I'm pursuing this career because I love working with digital art media.  I currently hold an AA degree in Graphic Design.  I'm thinking of taking 
    Digital Interface Design next semester.  I'm intrested in UX/UI.

     <h2>What I know about web design so far</h2>
    <p>I've learned how to aquire and configure a web hosting account. I have learned  HTML, and file organization.  I've learned to 
        create a mini website with various types of links, images and applying CSS styles for the world wide web.
         I've learned about transitions and animations,
        JavaScritpt basics, I also have experiance with Git and Github.
    </p>
        <h3>New things I hope to learn</h3>
<p>  Where do web designers apply for work?
      How much do web designers make? 
  I hope to learn more about JavaScript and Github. I wonder what else they can do.
